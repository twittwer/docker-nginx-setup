# CORS header support
# src - https://gist.github.com/Stanback/7145487
# One way to use this is by placing it into a file called "cors_support"
# under your Nginx configuration directory and placing the following
# statement inside your location block(s):
#
#   include cors_support;
#
# A limitation to this method is that Nginx doesn't currently send headers
# specified by add_header when the backend returns a 4xx or 5xx status code.
